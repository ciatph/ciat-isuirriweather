	- Set the working directory to the cloned repository, i.e.: <br>
		`setwd(setwd("D:/LAB/R/ciat-isuirriweather")`
	- Run `source("main.R")`.
	- Alternatively, you can do #4 instead.
4. Open main.bat in a text editor and set `pathtorexe` to your R's `\bin` installation directory. For example,<br>
	`set pathtorexe="C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.0\bin\"`
	- Click *main.bat* to run
5. Wait for (5) csv files to be generated in the `/extracted` directory:
	- export\_irri_014.csv
